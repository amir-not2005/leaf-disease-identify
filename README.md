# leaf-disease-identify
AI solution that uses pytorch and ResNet CNN to identify leaf disease among agricultural plants

# "agrotech (1).ipynb"
This file is prefferable way of testing our solution, as it does not require additional packages to be installed

# "test.zip"
In the "test.zip" file it is possible to find test images that we did not use for training our model. These can be used to check how does the solution work

# "plant-disease-model-complete.pth"
Please note, that this file can be installed if tested with "agrotech (1).ipynb" file
It is the model of our AI solution that gives more than 99% accuracy (val_acc: 0.9923)
